## Intro

This link will take you to the gh-pages deployment
where the first version of this small program
was published.

The link below here will take you to a more
performant implementations where I rekder a few
thousand balls and allow for tilting actions
on mobile

## Features

- **Drag and Drop** grab the balls and throw them around the screen, crash them into other balls and watch how the difference in size and elasticity effects the response
- **Tilt** on supported devices with tilt functionality, make the balls move around the screen by tilting your device

## Tech Stack

- **Vanilla JS** nothing special here other than an HTML5 canvas and vanilla js.
- **Modularity** this code base takes advantage of an object oriented design (OOP) to help separate concerns throughout the app from the main simulation logic down to each ball
